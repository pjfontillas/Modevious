        <h3>jQuery is a new kind of JavaScript Library.</h3>
        <h4>Latest version: 1.4.2</h4>
        <p>jQuery is a fast and concise JavaScript Library that simplifies HTML document traversing, event handling, animating, and Ajax   interactions for rapid web development. <strong>jQuery is designed to   change the way that you write JavaScript.</strong></p>

                    <p class="text-center"><span class="ui-icon ui-icon-info float-left"></span> <strong>The above information is taken directly from <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery's website</a>.</strong></p>

            <p>jQuery has been known to be the default contender when it comes to Javascript 
      libraries. In fact, most people don't use jQuery and Prototype together, mainly 
      because both use the $ selector in their scripts.</p>    
            <p>Luckily, jQuery allows you to modify that selector, and in our case we have 
      used $j; which is much like how we chose to use $c as our own selector for the 
      Core library.</p>
            <p>That leaves us with $ reserved for Prototype. Frankly, having these libraries 
      together provide you with a wealth of plugins to choose from; it also means you 
      probably won't have to look into other libraries like Mootools or ExtJS to write 
      the code for an application or plugin you've been thinking of doing.</p>
