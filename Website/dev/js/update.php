	"description": "MUpS (Modevious Update System) has finally been integrated and can be used by both users and developers. Modevious is more modular and can be copied to the root directory or any directory you want, we've got a way to sniff out the location of the resources needed to power Modevious! You can configure Modevious on the fly with no need to muck around in our source code. Simply set a variable and you'll override the default settings. Added support for context menus and patched several bugs and tweaked behavior for the console. Added a loading plugin (BlockUI), that prevents input on specified elements while the page loads or a request is processed. Prototype, jQuery, and jQuery UI have been updated to 1.7, 1.4.4, and 1.8.7, respectively.",
