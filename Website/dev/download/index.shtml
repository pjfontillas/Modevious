			<h1>Version 1.3 here!</h1>
			<p>MUpS (Modevious Update System) has finally been integrated and can be used by both users and developers. Modevious is more modular and can be copied to the root directory or any directory you want, we've got a way to sniff out the location of the resources needed to power Modevious! You can configure Modevious on the fly with no need to muck around in our source code. Simply set a variable and you'll override the default settings. Added support for context menus and patched several bugs and tweaked behavior for the console. Added a loading plugin (BlockUI), that prevents input on specified elements while the page loads or a request is processed. Prototype, jQuery, and jQuery UI have been updated to 1.7, 1.4.4, and 1.8.7, respectively.</p>
			<p>All updates <em>after version</em> 1.2 are <strong>cumulative</strong>. If you already installed and are using Modevious, simply grab the latest update you want and you've got all previous updates as well! Don't go backwards though... even though I cannot see any reason why you'd do so I'm willing to bet some of you will try or at least accidentally do it.</p>
			<p>Like what I've done? Care to help me buy a tie or a cup of coffee? I would definitely appreciate it!</p>
