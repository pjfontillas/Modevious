          <h2>What is distributed computing?</h2>
          <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing" title="View Wikipedia article">According to Wikipedia</a>:</p>
          <p class="padded quote">Distributed computing also refers to the use of distributed systems to solve 
          computational problems. In distributed computing, a problem is divided into 
          many tasks, each of which is solved by one computer.</p>
        </div></div>

          <p>With the agile progression of technology we are now at a point where
          just about any device with a web browser is capable of running JavaScript.</p>
          <p>Rather than placing almost all of the work on the web server we are now able
          to leverage the power of individual computers to help process our web pages
          and applications.</p>
          <p>Modevious attempts to alleviate the process of creating and maintaining web
          pages and applications that use client-based technologies to enhance our
          experience on the web.</p>

            <h2>Mobile optimization</h2>
            <p>Understandably, some mobile devices don't fully support
            JavaScript or have slower processors that would make running
            client-side code problematic.</p>
            <p>I'm well on my way to optimizing Modevious to support mobile
            devices in a way that facilitates developing for both the 
            desktop and the mobile experience.</p>
            <p>Mobile optimization will include features like blacklisting and
            whitelisting scripts that can run while on a mobile device. This can
            help allow necessary scripts to run while preventing resource hogging
            applications from loading on a mobile device.</p>
            <p>Don't worry, mobile support is a top priority. Between my iPhone, my
            brother's G1, and multiple Blackberry's I have experience truly
            horrendous browsing experiences using a mobile browser. But I have
            also seen efficient and user-friendly presentations as well so I am
            certain mobile optimization is plausible.</p>

            <h2>Possible jQuery conlicts</h2>
            <p>If you already run jQuery scripts check to see if the author
            implemented the encapsulation method for running jQuery code.</p>
            <p>One of the biggest problems with using the Prototype JS and jQuery
            libraries together was the conflicting use of '$'.</p>
            <p>If the author did not protect calls to their script from this conflict
            you will have to convert their run-time script - the script or code that
            initializes their application. Change all references to '$' to '$j' to
            have it work with Modevious.</p>

          <h2>jQuery UI</h2>
          <p>The jQuery UI is currently just about the extent of theming Modevious directly
          deals with.</p>
          <p>Modevious comes with its own custom jQuery UI theme but feel free to
          <a href="http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/" 
          title="Go to the jQuery UI Theme Roller">roll your own.</a> Just
          remember to replace the appropriate files and try to stay within the
          correct jQuery and jQuery UI versions.</p>

          <h2>Core CSS</h2>
          <p>Remember <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/CSS/css_howto.asp"
          title="W3 Schools info on CSS">inline-styling?</a> <strong>Don't use that</strong>.</p>
          <p>For the most common applications of inline-styling 
          there are <a href="css/core.css" title="Core CSS Rules">Core CSS classes</a> that will provide all the markup needed. Need to make
          the text in a certain paragraph left-aligned? Use the class "text-left". Need
          an element to float? Apply the class "float-left" or "float-right".</p>
          <p>I encourage this use because that certain style may apply to only one page 
          or a specific element, in which case I then believe it is better to 
          leave it out of the global CSS rules.</p>
