					<h2>What is cloud computing?</h2>
					<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing" title="View Wikipedia article">According to Wikipedia</a>:</p>
					<p class="padded quote">Cloud computing is Internet-based computing, whereby shared resources, software, and information are provided to computers and other devices on demand, like the electricity grid.</p>
				</div></div>
				<div class="half"><div class="padded">
					<h2>How does that affect me?</h2>
					<p>With the agile progression of technology we are now at a point where just about any device with a web browser is capable of running JavaScript.</p>
					<p>Rather than placing almost all of the work on the web server we are now able to leverage the power of individual computers to help process our web pages and applications.</p>
					<p>Modevious attempts to alleviate the process of creating and maintaining web pages and applications that use client-based technologies to enhance our experience on the web.</p>
				</div></div>
			</div>
			<div id="know" class="hidden splash-item padded-x">
					<div class="half"><div class="padded">
						<h2>Mobile optimization</h2>
						<p>Understandably, some mobile devices don't fully support JavaScript or have slower processors that would make running client-side code problematic.</p>
						<p>I'm well on my way to optimizing Modevious to support mobile devices in a way that facilitates developing for both the  desktop and the mobile experience.</p>
						<p>Mobile optimization will include features like blacklisting and whitelisting scripts that can run while on a mobile device. This can help allow necessary scripts to run while preventing resource hogging applications from loading on a mobile device.</p>
					</div></div>
					<div class="half"><div class="padded">
						<h2>Possible jQuery conlicts</h2>
						<p>If you already run jQuery scripts check to see if the author implemented the <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Using_jQuery_with_Other_Libraries#Referencing_Magic_-_Shortcuts_for_jQuery" title="Fixes conflicts">referencing method for running jQuery code</a>.</p>
						<p>One of the biggest problems with using the Prototype JS and jQuery libraries together was the conflicting use of '$'.</p>
						<p>If the author did not protect calls to their script from this conflict you will have to convert their run-time script - the script or code that initializes their application. Change all references to '$' to '$j' to have it work with Modevious.</p>
					</div></div>
			</div>
			<div id="theming" class="hidden splash-item no-padding">
				<div class="half"><div class="padded">
					<h2>jQuery UI</h2>
					<p>The jQuery UI is currently just about the extent of theming Modevious directly deals with.</p>
					<p>Modevious comes with its own custom jQuery UI theme but feel free to
					<a href="http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/" title="Go to the jQuery UI Theme Roller">roll your own.</a> Just remember to replace the appropriate files and try to stay within the correct jQuery and jQuery UI versions.</p>
				</div></div>
				<div class="half"><div class="padded">
					<h2>Core CSS</h2>
					<p>Remember <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/CSS/css_howto.asp" title="W3 Schools info on CSS">inline-styling?</a> <strong>Don't use that</strong>.</p>
					<p>For the most common applications of inline-styling there are <a href="css/modevious/core.css" title="Core CSS Rules">Core CSS classes</a> that will provide all the markup needed. Need to make the text in a certain paragraph left-aligned? Use the class "text-left". Need an element to float? Apply the class "float-left" or "float-right".</p>
					<p>I encourage this use because that certain style may apply to only one page or a specific element, in which case I then believe it is better to leave it out of the global CSS rules.</p>
