				<h1>"Merging Our DEVelopment Into One Universal System"</h1>
				<p>Modevious is a collection, testing tool, and maintenance system of JavaScript libraries and plugins.</p>
				<p>Saying there will be one universal system may be over-reaching a bit, but the idea is that everything can work together.</p>
				<p>Many tools essential to building an interactive site or application are already included in our library. No need to search for them.</p>
				<p>Modevious also employs an update system that makes it easier for plugin authors and users to keep things up-to-date.</p>

				<h1>What is cloud computing?</h1>
				<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing" title="View Wikipedia article">According to Wikipedia</a>:</p>
				<p class="padded quote">Cloud computing is Internet-based computing, whereby shared resources, software, and information are provided to computers and other devices on demand, like the electricity grid.</p>
			</div></div>
			<div class="half"><div class="padded">
				<h1>How does that affect me?</h1>
				<p>With the agile progression of technology we are now at a point where just about any device with a web browser is capable of running JavaScript.</p>
				<p>Rather than placing almost all of the work on the web server we are now able to leverage the power of individual computers to help process our web pages and applications.</p>
				<p>Modevious attempts to alleviate the process of creating and maintaining web pages and applications that use client-based technologies to enhance our experience on the web.</p>

					<h1>Possible jQuery conlicts</h1>
					<p>If you already run jQuery scripts check to see if the author implemented the <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Using_jQuery_with_Other_Libraries#Referencing_Magic_-_Shortcuts_for_jQuery" title="Fixes conflicts">referencing method for running jQuery code</a>.</p>
					<p>One of the biggest problems with using the Prototype JS and jQuery libraries together was the conflicting use of '$'.</p>
					<p>If the author did not protect calls to their script from this conflict you will have to convert their run-time script - the script or code that initializes their application. Change all references to '$' to '$j' to have it work with Modevious.</p>

					<h1>Mobile optimization</h1>
					<p>Modevious is designed for the desktop user experience. If you're looking for a library that is designed from the ground up to cater to mobile needs check out <a href="http://jquerymobile.com" title="For a good mobile UX">jQuery Mobile</a>.</p>
					<p>You <strong>can</strong> use Modevious on the mobile platform, you may just get some uncommon behavior or decreased performance based on the hardware it runs on.</p>

				<h1>jQuery UI</h1>
				<p>The jQuery UI is currently just about the extent of theming Modevious directly deals with.</p>
				<p>Modevious comes with its own custom jQuery UI theme but feel free to
				<a href="http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/" title="Go to the jQuery UI Theme Roller">roll your own.</a> Just remember to replace the appropriate files and try to stay within the correct jQuery and jQuery UI versions.</p>
			</div></div>
			<div class="half"><div class="padded">
				<h1>Core CSS</h1>
				<p>Remember <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/CSS/css_howto.asp" title="W3 Schools info on CSS">inline-styling?</a> <strong>Don't use that</strong>.</p>
				<p>For the most common applications of inline-styling there are <a href="css/modevious/core.css" title="Core CSS Rules">Core CSS classes</a> that will provide all the markup needed. Need to make the text in a certain paragraph left-aligned? Use the class "text-left". Need an element to float? Apply the class "float-left" or "float-right".</p>
				<p>I encourage this use because that certain style may apply to only one page or a specific element, in which case I then believe it is better to leave it out of the global CSS rules.</p>
